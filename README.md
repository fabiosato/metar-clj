# metar-clj

A Clojure library designed to parse METAR data files.

This library relies on the great instaparse library to create a very robust implementation of a METAR decoder.

The grammar was based on the official documents from WMO (CODE Forms and Appendix III).

## Example

lein run resources/sbct.txt
